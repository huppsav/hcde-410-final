# hcde-410-final

My proposed final project is to look into what factors contribute to a contestant winning the season of the bachelor/bachlorette or making it super far. The factors I will be looking into are age gap between contestants and the lead and distances between the contestant and leads hometown. 

I plan to use a bachelor dataset from github: https://github.com/adashofdata/bachelor_data

In this dataset in the seasons csv file, these values are represented: show, season, name, profile, winner, runner-ups, proposal, success, birthday, height, 

For the bachelor datasets these are the values represented: season, year, name, age, hometown, occupation, eliminated

This dataset should be suitable for my research goal since it gives me all information on the bachelor leads which I can then use for comparing the age gap and hometown distances between the leads of the season and the winning contestants.
