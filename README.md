# hcde-410-final: Analyzing Age Gaps between the Bachelor/Bachelorette lead and Contestants 

My final project is looking into what factors contribute to a contestant winning the season of the bachelor/bachlorette or making it to the finale. The factor I will be looking at is age gap between contestants and the lead.

I collected data and created my own dataset about the leads and contestants from the Bachelor and Bachelorette Nation Fandom: https://bachelor-nation.fandom.com/wiki/The_Bachelor 
https://bachelor-nation.fandom.com/wiki/The_Bachelorette

In the bachelor dataset, these values are represented: Season, Bachelor, B_Age, B_Hometown, Winner, W_Age, W_Hometown, RunnerUp, R_Age_R_Hometown

On the Bachelor page of the website there was incomplete data from seasons 6 and 8 and season 11 had no winners so those got cut from my dataset to preserve the accuracy of my dataset

In the bachelorette dataset, these values are represented: Season, Bachelorette, B_Age, B_Hometown, Winner, W_Age, W_Hometown, RunnerUp, R_Age_R_Hometown

On the Bachelorette page, one of the bachelorette leads from season 16 got cut due to incomplete data

Creating my own dataset allowed me to use all seasons from the reality Tv shows as well as make sure that I could access the ages of all people during their time on the show. This dataset should be suitable for my research goal since it gives me all information on the bachelor leads and contestants who made it to the finale which I can then use for comparing the age gap between the leads of the season and the winning contestants.
