This project looks into age gaps between contestants and the leads in determining if this factor helps contestants on the Bachelor and/or Bachelorette make it to the finale of the show. By using data I collected from Bachelor Nation Fandom and Bachelorette Nation Fandom, I analyzed the age gaps between leads and contestants, specifically the winners and runner ups across all seasons of the show and found the % of age gaps for gaps 5 years and under or more than 5 years. Results from the study show 64% of leads on the Bachelor chose a winner with a 5 year or less age gap while 86.4% of leads on the Bachelorette chose a winner who had an age gap of 5 or less years, suggesting that closer age gaps are more likely to win in the show. 
Despite these findings, frther research would be neccessary to determine if this is a larger factor in choosing a winner over other potential factors.
